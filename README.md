# Sortable-Angular-Containers
This is a small app that will allow you to drag and drop items between two containers. This is really more of a reference. But feel free to use it to your needs.

To see the app run. Download and run "npm install" in the cmd. 

* It only has 2 dependencies Express and EJS. * 

This app also uses Angular UI Sortable. Which you can read about [here](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-sortable)
